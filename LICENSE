# Modding Policy

## Overview

City Bus Manager (Text Version) supports user-created **mods** and **DLC vehicle packs** to expand gameplay.  
This document outlines how mods can be created, shared, and used, as well as the responsibilities of creators and players.

## 1. Ownership of Mods

- All **user-generated mods** remain the **property of their respective creators**.  
- By uploading or sharing a mod, you grant permission for others to use and modify it within the context of the game.  
- Mods **do not transfer any ownership** of the base game or its source code.

## 2. Licensing and Distribution

- The base game is licensed under the **MIT License (c) 2025 shay-coding**.  
- Mods are **not automatically licensed under MIT** unless the creator explicitly states so.  
- You may distribute your mods freely, provided they:
  - Do not contain copyrighted or trademarked content owned by others.  
  - Do not include the full game or any paid assets.  
  - Clearly identify the mod’s author and version.  

## 3. Compatibility and Liability

- Mods are created by the community and are **not officially supported or guaranteed** by the developer.  
- The developer (**shay-coding**) assumes **no responsibility** for:
  - Bugs, crashes, or save corruption caused by third-party mods.  
  - Loss of data or system issues resulting from user modifications.  
- Always **back up your saves** before installing or removing mods.

## 4. Content Guidelines

When creating or sharing mods, please ensure your content:

- Does not include hateful, discriminatory, or explicit material.  
- Respects the intellectual property of other creators and companies.  
- Keeps gameplay fair and balanced for all players.

## 5. Reporting Issues

If a mod causes crashes or conflicts:
- First, try running the base game without mods to confirm it’s not a core issue.  
- Report reproducible bugs in the **official GitHub issues** section, noting if mods were active.

## 6. Developer Rights

The developer reserves the right to:
- Remove links to unsafe or infringing mods.  
- Update the base game in ways that may unintentionally break old mods.  
- Incorporate ideas or mechanics inspired by mods (without using mod assets directly).

## 7. Official DLC Packs

Official DLCs curated by the developer are available here:  
👉 [Official DLC Folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gSySG89u-Sa8WN7JUTkuF0Upp9qig66G?usp=drive_link)

These packs follow the same open JSON structure and are compatible with the modding system.

## 8. Summary

You are free to:
✅ Create, share, and modify mods  
✅ Distribute them for free  
✅ Customize your experience  

You must not:
❌ Redistribute the base game or its source code as your own  
❌ Use copyrighted material without permission  
❌ Hold the developer liable for issues caused by mods
