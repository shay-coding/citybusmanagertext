## 1. Ownership of Mods

- All **user-generated mods** remain the **property of their respective creators**.

- The base game is licensed under the **MIT License (c) 2025 shay-coding**.  
- Mods are **not automatically licensed under MIT** unless the creator explicitly states so.  
- You may distribute your mods freely, provided they:
  - Do not contain copyrighted or trademarked content owned by others.  
  - Do not include the full game or any paid assets.  
  - Clearly identify the mod’s author and version.

## 3. Compatibility and Liability

- Mods are created by the community and are **not officially supported or guaranteed** by the developer.  
- The developer (**shay-coding**) assumes **no responsibility** for:
  - Bugs, crashes, or save corruption caused by third-party mods.  
  - Loss of data or system issues resulting from user modifications.

## 5. Reporting Issues

If a mod causes crashes or conflicts:
- First, try running the base game without mods to confirm it’s not a core issue.  
- Report reproducible bugs in the **official GitHub issues** section, noting if mods were active.

## 6. Developer Rights

The developer reserves the right to:
- Remove links to unsafe or infringing mods.  
- Update the base game in ways that may unintentionally break old mods.  
- Incorporate ideas or mechanics inspired by mods (without using mod assets directly).
